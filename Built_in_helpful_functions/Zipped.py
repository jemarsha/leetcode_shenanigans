# Zipped Function
"""
Returns an iterator of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element
from each of the argument sequences or iterables.
The iterator stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted.
With a single iterable argument, it returns an iterator of 1-tuples.
With no arguments, it returns an empty iterator.
